This project has been generated by the lagom/lagom-scala.g8 template. 

It uses [akka-persistence-jdbc](https://github.com/dnvriend/akka-persistence-jdbc) with a custom DAO for reading tags using equality instead of wildcard.

It's a workaround for bug https://github.com/dnvriend/akka-persistence-jdbc/issues/168. This is NOT a definitive solution and wasn't tested extensively. Make sure you run enough tests before using it in production. This workaround should only be used for events with single tags.

It contains a simplified bank account sample and runs on postgres. See docker-compose.yml.
